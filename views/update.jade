    li: pre echo "Hello There" | pbcopy # change their clipboard contents
    li: pre open -a chrome http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh7lp9umG2I

    li Thanks to

     |  for this: You'll have to write it yourself, but the idea is to install
     | another cron job that every hour, on the hour, speaks the time. Similar
     | to a built-in OS X capability, but impossible to turn off if they don't
     | know where it's coming from.
  p For Linux:
  ul
    li: pre DISPLAY=:0 xdg-open http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh7lp9umG2I
     | # Don't think that Linux users get to escape He-Man
     | # DISPLAY=:0 is necessary for anything that involves X
